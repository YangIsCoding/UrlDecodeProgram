# UrlDecodeProgram

 This program is used to decode URL-encoded strings. It iterates through the input string, decoding URL-encoded characters into their corresponding ASCII characters, and outputs them to standard output. Additionally, it checks the format of the input string for correctness, and if the format is incorrect, it outputs an error message.
